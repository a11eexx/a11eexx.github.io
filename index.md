### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4 Part 2 was one of my favorite labs because it reminded my of my first time coding. Over the summer I first started learning to code in python and one of my first projects was a very similar game. Doing this in C++ made me realize some of the similarities in both coding languages which made it one of the easier and funner labs for me personally.

* Lab 10

    I also enoyed Lab 10 Part 1 only because of how much liberty we were given. All of the labs leading up to then had very detailed instructions and hints on how to go about coding what needed to be done. However Lab 10, was more vague and really left it up to us on how we wanted to go about solving it.

* Lab 9
    
    Lab 9 Part 2 was interesting because of the use of two different source files. When my code didn't run I had to take a minute to evalute which file the error was coming from which was actually fun to me. It was interesting calling numbers/functions from one file into the other and made it all the more exciting.
